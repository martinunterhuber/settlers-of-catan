## About the game

Since the game can only be played as online multiplayer, all players need an internet-enabled device. One of the devices serves as a server. The other players join this server by entering its IP address.

At the beginning, each player can build two settlements and roads free of charge. Then the normal gameplay begins: At the beginning, the player has to roll the dice. Depending on the rolled number, the resources will be distributed and the current player can choose from the following options:

### Game board
As usual, the game board consists of 19 hexagonal fields that are assigned to a specific resource and have a dice value between 2-12. Settlements can be built at each node of the fields, which are connected by roads. Some nodes are harbour settlements. A black ship symbol can be seen at those nodes. The arrangement of the fields is randomly generated at the beginning of each game, just like the arrangement of the dice values. The desert is the only exception. It remains in the middle of the board every time a new game is created.
